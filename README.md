# TicTacToe
Console Based TicTacToe game with 2 difficulty levels

This mainstream, boring TicTacToe game was made because I was bored and wanted people to see I can code.

So basically, the game is played with you and the computer, because you dont have friends, apologies!. The computer plays with the "O" and you will play with the "X" symbol.

The computer can be set to 3 levels, actually 2 working ones as the 3rd level is still under development

Level 1: The computer is an idiot who randomly places his piece anywhere even if he loses

Level 2: The computer is that annoying guy/gal! who doesnt let you win nor does he/she win

Level 3: The computer will thrash you

The game was made using numpy(employers watch out!) to make the board and handling the matrices used to make the board easy to work with.
The game will display the board(which I am really proud about!) after each turn, updating the board based on the symbols added.
Basically the program is an endless loop of TicTacToe games until you say quits or your laptop runs out of charge!.

For the script kiddies out there, make sure you have Python 3.6 or later and do install numpy using pip.

I hope you will enjoy the work done by me

PS. Sorry for the informal and humourous language dear hiring managers, I hope you still consider me for the placement
